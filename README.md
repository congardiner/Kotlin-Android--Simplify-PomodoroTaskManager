# Overview

The purpose of this personal project was to explore the world of Android Studio by creating a basic Kotlin Application, that utilizes core components of the Java language and dependency packages withih Kotlin in order to deliver a personal take something that I use everyday, 'task management'. I chose to focus on something dear to me, productivity. More specifically I've enjoyed fine tuning process of learning how to learn efficiently for me, which will vary person to person, but the base core requirements remain the same. We all have needs, with those needs come a desire to fulfill our greatest potentials, and all to often we fall short of our goals not only because life is hard but more specifically in some instances due to how we approach solving our problems. Life is full of distractions, too many to count, but with that there are also loads of tools openly available at all times to aid us. Simplify, as the name implies is an augmented personal take on task management, in that too often our goals are middled with layers of complexity that restrict us from being able to focus. If we lose ourselves to the pressures of life, especially when our focus is completely lost to too many 'things' well we end up losing. I despise losing, I am sure you share similar feelings. Focusing on one thing at a time can help remediate in a simple way that feeling and the outcome of losing. Regret, it is something that we will all carry throughout life, but how much will you choose to carry because of the decisions you are making now?

While this space has been explored extensively by many industry professionals, I've attempted to create my own rendition of a task manager to boost producitivity and overall awareness to time spent on discrete objectives. 

My application utilizes three simplified views to aid you in accomplishing your tasks:

1) Homescreen when tasks can be inputted, crossed off when completed, and deleted altogether.
2) A Pomodoro Clock preset to 25 minutes intervals, to help you start and end flows.
3) Lastly, a hands-on Pomodoro Guide to enlighten as well as encourage you in your personal journey!

The application itself is supportable for devices with Android 8.0 and above, for the purposes of this project, I ran this all within the virtual emulating service provided by Android Studio.

I hope that you enjoy this brief demo, feel free to tag along for the YouTube Demo to see this in action!

# Future Work

- Something that I plan to update in the future is the behavior of the inbuilt clock, as of right now, it doesn't provide runtime capabilities while the application is closed (ie, at least within the virtual environment) which would need to be implemented properly to scale for a common user base.
- Another item that would vastly improve the continuity of this application is a 'settings' window dedicated to user personalization, not only within the application itself, but integrated with the ability to share tasks with other users, so that conjointly if needed visibility between two parties would aid in resolving accountability between joint goals.
- The Pomodoro Effect as explained could be improved with cited pictures/videos to assist in usability, as well as, improvements to the base app in terms of on demand performance, visual overhauling of UI elements, and even fine tuning animations to curate to a personalized user experience.
